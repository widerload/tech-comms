# Multi Factor Authentication (a.k.a. Two Factor Authentication)

## Overview

This is a much needed extension to the age old password and it originates from the idea that identity should be established by three pillars:

1. Something you are. (Username)
2. Something you know. (Password)
3. Something you have.

The thing that you have could be one of a number of things but typically it either relates to a mobile device you have or in some cases a separate little device that displays a code.

If you use a mobile device for MFA then there are a few options for how it could be implemented:

- It could be a one-use code which is sent to your phone.
- It could be a changing code which you get from an app.
- It could be a prompt which you have to approve.
- It could be a biometric requirement, such as a fingerprint.
- Or a combination or the above, or other methods.

## Benefits of using MFA

MFA allows for much better security while adding very little time to the authentication process by making it much more difficult for an attacker who is not physically close to you to access your accounts. Given that the majority of attackers who target ordinary people are in Russia, the middle east and Asia, for many people who are not in those regions and do not have ties to those regions this option can grant a much needed security improvement to

## Backup options if you lose access to your device

Typically the organisations who make use of these are well aware that there are some circumstances where someone may lose access to their device and so typically there are backup options available to users that they can use if they want. These often take the form of backup codes, phone or email codes etc.
